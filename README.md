# Visario_Android
The Visario project is an example of the implementation of a communication platform based on Amazon Chime SDK by the engineers of the Inmost team. AWS microservices make it easy to create chats, appointments, calendars, and other functions within an existing client app or website. The received communication features are distinguished by the high quality of communication, data transmission security, and minimal implementation time.
